## Observer Design Pattern
The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Key Concepts
**Subject**: The object that holds the state and sends notifications to the observers.

**Observer**: The object that needs to be informed about changes in the subject.

**Concrete Subject**: The actual object holding the state of interest.

**Concrete Observer**: The objects that get updated when the subject's state changes.

### Structure
**Subject Interface**: Maintains a list of observers and provides methods to attach and detach observers.

**Concrete Subject**: Implements the subject interface and holds the state of interest.

**Observer Interface**: Defines the update method that will be called by the subject to notify the observers.

**Concrete Observer**: Implements the observer interface and defines the actions to be taken when notified by the subject.

|+setState()        |
+-------------------+
        ^

| Concrete Observer |

|+update()          |
+-------------------+

```

### Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: The subject and observers are loosely coupled. The subject only knows that observers implement the Observer interface. It does not need to know the concrete implementation.


- **Dynamic Relationships**: Observers can be added or removed at runtime.


- **Broadcast Communication**: One update from the subject can be communicated to all observers, providing an efficient way to handle state changes.

### Drawbacks
- **Memory Leaks**: If observers are not correctly removed, it may lead to memory leaks.

- **Update Cascading**: A single change can cause a cascade of updates, potentially leading to performance issues if not managed correctly.

### Real-World Examples
- **Event Handling Systems**: GUI frameworks where UI components listen for events.

- **Notification Systems**: Email or messaging notification systems where users subscribe to certain topics or events.

- **Data Binding in UI**: Frameworks like Angular and React use a form of the Observer pattern to keep the UI in sync with the underlying data model.
