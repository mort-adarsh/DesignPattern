# Design pattern
A design pattern in software engineering is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 
Design patterns are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code; they are templates that describe how to solve a problem in various situations.

Here are the main categories of design patterns having over 23 design pattern:
## Creational Patterns:
- These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
- Examples:
  ### Singleton:
  - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
  ### Factory Method:
  - Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
  ### Abstract Factory:
  - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
  ### Builder:
  - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
  ### Prototype:
  - Creates a new object by copying an existing object.

## Structural Patterns:
- These patterns deal with object composition, forming larger structures from objects.
- Examples:
  ### Adapter:
  - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
  ### Decorator: 
  - Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
  ### Facade:
    - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
  ### Composite:
  - Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
  ### Proxy:  
  - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.
  ### Bridge:
  - Bridge pattern is to decouple an abstraction from its implementation
  ### Flyweight:
  - helps to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects 
  ### Filter (Not in 23):

## Behavioral Patterns :
- These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- Examples:
  ### Chain of Responsibility:
  ### Observer:  
  - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
  ### Strategy:  
  - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
  ### Command:
  - Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
  ### Iterator:  
  - Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
  ### State:  
  - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
  ### Interpreter:
  ### Mediator:
  ### Template Method Pattern:


### Benefits of Using Design Patterns
#### Reusability:  Patterns provide reusable solutions that can be applied to different problems in different contexts.
#### Maintainability:  Patterns provide clear and well-structured solutions, making code easier to understand, maintain, and modify.
#### Efficiency:  Patterns can lead to efficient solutions by avoiding reinventing the wheel and reusing proven methods.
#### Communication:  Patterns provide a common language for developers to discuss and share solutions.
